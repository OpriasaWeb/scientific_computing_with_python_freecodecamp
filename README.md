🧠 Learning Tips
✅ Internalize the README of each project before coding

🧪 Run main.py examples to understand expected behavior

🧩 Solve one test case at a time to avoid overwhelm

🔍 Use test_module.py to debug and compare expected vs actual output

💬 Ask questions in the freeCodeCamp forum if stuck

🧪 Project Completion Workflow
Read the project instructions carefully

Write your code locally or on Replit

Test using provided unit tests

Submit your solution on freeCodeCamp to verify

Repeat for all five projects to earn your certification
